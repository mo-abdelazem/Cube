# Nebula Backend (NestJS API)

This is the backend API for the Nebula E-commerce Platform, built with NestJS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **NestJS** - Progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications
- **Prisma** - Modern database toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript, used as an ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Powerful, open-source object-relational database system
- **JWT** - For secure authentication and authorization
- **Swagger** - For API documentation and testing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/ecommerce_db?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="7d"
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV="development"
API_PREFIX="api/v1"
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES="jpg,jpeg,png,webp"
```

### 3. Database Setup

Generate Prisma client, push your schema to the database, and seed initial data:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push --force-reset
npx prisma db seed
```

### 4. Create Required Directories

Ensure directories for uploads are in place:

```bash
mkdir -p uploads/products
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The API will be available at:

- **Base URL:** http://localhost:3001/api/v1
- **Swagger Docs:** http://localhost:3001/api/v1/docs

## üìã API Reference

The backend API is extensively documented via Swagger. For full details, please refer to the Swagger documentation at http://localhost:3001/api/v1/docs once the backend server is running.

## üß™ API Testing Examples

Once your backend is running, you can use these curl commands to test some of the core functionalities:

### Register a new user

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User"
  }'
```

### Login with seeded admin

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "admin123"
  }'
```

### Search products

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/search/products?q=shirt&minPrice=10&maxPrice=50"
```

### Get featured products

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/products/featured"
```

### Add to cart (requires authentication token)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/cart/items \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## üîí Security Notes

- Change the JWT_SECRET in production
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting for production
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regularly update dependencies

## üöÄ Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set NODE_ENV to "production"
2. Use a secure JWT_SECRET
3. Configure your production database URL
4. Set up proper logging
5. Implement monitoring and health checks

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Database Connection Issues:**

- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check DATABASE_URL in .env file
- Verify database credentials

**Port Already in Use:**

- Change PORT in .env file
- Kill existing processes using the port

**Prisma Issues:**

- Run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes
- Use `npx prisma db push` to sync database
